**Sandbox.WeatherCalculations**
===========================
Code compiled in this project was gleaned from [C# Source Code To Calculate Weather Data](http://wiki.crowe.co.nz/Conversions.ashx)

I wanted to put it on github so that people can fork it and share it easier.
I have cleaned up a bit of it and made it easier to leverage in one's applications I hope.

- [ ] Build and deploy NuGet package
- [ ] Build version of this library in F#
- [ ] Make a function that actually does the Heat Index Calculation - as opposed to pulling from the table.
- [x] Build static functions for all of the calculations
- [x] Copy Functionality from Conversion Page
